 ## Features 
-Real-time safety cones detection
-Accurate localization and classification of safety cones
-Easy-to-use interface for running inference on images or video streams

### *Installation*
To install YOLOv8, please follow this link, which contains comprehensive 
documentation that will be beneficial to you: https://docs.ultralytics.com/

### *Dataset*
In this project, I used the Roboflow dataset
